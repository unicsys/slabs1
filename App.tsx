Success Story: Raptor Clone Digital Twin
From Confusion to Clarity with REO Canvas
ðŸŽ¯
Project Context
P&W EDX building digital twin for Turbine Exhaust Caseâ€”integrating maintenance, inspection, sensor, and operation data from multiple bases for thermal barrier coating loss prediction
ðŸš¨The Business Challenges
âœ•
No common way of thinking about information across data sources
âœ•
Difficult to onboard data from multiple sources with different formats (tables, XML)
âœ•
Hard to create abstractions and mappingsâ€”no clear structure
âœ•
Team confused about ontology: what it is, how to build it, how to apply it
âœ•
Business users couldn't contributeâ€”process too technical and abstract
ðŸ’¡The Solution: REO Canvas
Simplified Ontology Development Framework
Business-friendly canvas with 5 clear categories aligned with BFO: Material Things, Qualities/Functions/Roles, Information Things (Descriptive, Prescriptive, Identifiers), Processes, and Time Periods. Teams map column headers like "JCN" directly into these categoriesâ€”making ontology development visual and collaborative.
Visual & Intuitive Business User Friendly Structured Categorization Direct Column Mapping BFO Aligned
ðŸ“ˆMeasurable Business Impact
40%
Faster Ontology Development
5Ã—
More Business User Participation
70-80%
Faster Verification Process
100%
Team Understanding in Minutes
ðŸŽ‰
The Transformation
People who were confused about ontology now clearly see how concepts are categorized and connected. Canvas concepts move directly into formal ontologyâ€”bridging business understanding and technical implementation.
