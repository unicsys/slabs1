LLM-Powered Ontology Canvas for Human–Machine Teaming and Semantic Data Integration

Selling Point (Customer Perspective):
Digital-engineering programs—Digital Twin, Digital Thread, Digital Transformation, and MBSE—all require robust data integration. Ontologies are the foundation, yet semantic definition is today’s biggest AI bottleneck. Our Ontology Canvas Framework integrates LLMs with intuitive visual tools to let engineers, analysts, and business users collaboratively build and deploy ontologies—without hundreds of specialized engineers.

🔹 Problem Definition & Impact (Left Quadrant)

Problem Definition

Data scattered across tools & programs; no common semantics.

Digital Twin, Thread, and Engineering initiatives stall without ontology alignment.

Semantic definition remains manual, slow, and expert-limited.

Commercial vendors (e.g., Palantir) succeed only by deploying large, costly teams—unaffordable for many Gov/Defense users.

Government agencies need low-overhead, explainable, in-house capability.

Relation to Seedling Solicitation

Directly addresses digital-engineering automation, trusted AI, and human–machine teaming for semantic integration.

Impact

Democratizes ontology development through visual AI collaboration.

40 % faster ontology build; massive cost reduction vs. manual modeling.

Lays semantic backbone for Digital Twin, Thread, and Transformation.

CRAD Targets: NASA (standards alignment), DoD DE office, Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) for supply-chain semantics, U.S. Customs & Border Protection (CBP) and partner homeland-security agencies for data-fusion and decision-support use cases.

Transition Path: Integrate into RTX DTX / Nexus pipelines; offer joint pilots with DLA & CBP.

🔹 New Idea (Right Quadrant)

Idea

Ontology Canvas Framework combining LLM reasoning with visual ontology-editing.

Human–machine teaming to onboard diverse stakeholders.

Converts standards & program docs (NASA, DoD, MIL) into ontologies.

Novelty

First integrated platform blending LLM-assisted semantic extraction + drag-and-drop ontology building.

Replaces vendor armies with a self-service, explainable toolkit.

Continuously learns from SME feedback to improve models.

Value Beyond Current Practice

Makes ontology engineering accessible to all DE practitioners.

Rapid onboarding across domains (systems, logistics, border ops).

Open, extensible, secure—unlike proprietary data-fusion stacks.

Risks / Mitigation

LLM inaccuracies → governed review loop + ontology validator.

Security → hosted in RTX-secured Azure environment with audit logging.

Why It Succeeds

Builds on RTX’s DPHM & REO ontology heritage.

Aligns with enterprise Digital Thread and affordability imperatives.

Directly answers Gov frustration with costly, closed data platforms.

🔹 Path Forward / Seeding Plan (Bottom Quadrant)

Seeding (5 mo / $120 K):
Deliver LLM-integrated Ontology Canvas prototype for visual, guided ontology creation.

Milestone 1 (Mid-term):
Curated dataset of NASA, DoD, MIL, and DLA standards; ontology schema generated via LLM + SME review.

Milestone 2 (Final):
Working Ontology Canvas demo showing rapid creation and deployment of a cross-domain Knowledge Graph for supply-chain / border-ops data.

CRAD Marketing Strategy:

Target NASA, DLA, CBP, and USSF / Space Systems Command for pilots.
