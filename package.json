Digital Twin, Digital Thread, Digital Transformation, and Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) initiatives all rely on effective data integration and semantic consistency. Ontologies are the backbone of this integration, yet ontology creation remains slow, costly, and dependent on a small pool of experts. Today, the semantic definition layer is the biggest bottleneck in AI systems. Vendors such as Palantir deploy hundreds of engineers to build proprietary knowledge models, leaving government and aerospace organizations frustrated by high cost, long timelines, and vendor lock-in.

This project introduces an LLM-Powered Ontology Canvas, a human–machine teaming framework that democratizes ontology and knowledge-graph development. By combining Large Language Models (LLMs) with a visual, collaborative canvas, the tool enables analysts, engineers, and program managers to co-create ontologies without deep semantic-web expertise. Users can import NASA, DoD, MIL, DLA, or CBP standards, and the LLM automatically suggests ontology classes, relationships, and constraints. Humans validate or refine these AI suggestions through an intuitive interface, ensuring correctness and explainability.

The approach accelerates ontology generation by more than 40 %, while improving affordability and accessibility. It creates a repeatable, scalable process for semantic modeling, aligning directly with RTX’s digital-thread and knowledge-graph initiatives. The Ontology Canvas will support multi-domain integration—from systems engineering to logistics and border-operations data fusion—while maintaining traceability and version control in a secure RTX cloud environment.

The technology will reach TRL 4 through a prototype demonstrating ontology creation, validation, and deployment into an enterprise knowledge graph. The project will engage 15 + RTX SMEs across ongoing ontology efforts (DPHM, REO, Manufacturing, Supply Chain, Digital Thread) and position RTX for CRAD partnerships with NASA, the Defense Logistics Agency, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and DoD digital-engineering offices.
