🔹 Right Quadrant — New Idea

Idea

Combine Large Language Models with an interactive visual canvas for ontology generation.

Human-machine teaming: users drag, label, and verify AI-suggested classes & relations.

Auto-generate OWL/RDF structures and knowledge-graph instances.

Novelty

First low-code semantic-engineering environment powered by LLM reasoning.

Continuously learns from SME feedback to refine ontology logic.

Bridges gap between AI teams, business analysts, and MBSE engineers.

Value Beyond Current Practice

Democratizes semantic modeling; 10× reduction in manpower vs. traditional methods.

Reduces ontology-build time by >40 %.

Creates reusable assets feeding RTX Digital Thread and enterprise AI initiatives.

Risks / Mitigation

AI hallucination → human validation loop, ontology reasoner checks.

Security → Azure OpenAI in RTX secure cloud; audit and access control.
