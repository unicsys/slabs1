Digital Twin, Thread, and Engineering programs all depend on semantic data integration, yet ontology development remains slow and expert-limited. Our LLM-Powered Ontology Canvas enables human-machine teaming through visual tools and AI assistance, letting analysts and engineers collaboratively build ontologies. The framework replaces costly vendor efforts and accelerates interoperability for NASA, DLA, CBP, and RTX programs.
