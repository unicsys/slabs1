LLM-Powered Human–Machine Teaming in Ontology & Knowledge Graph Development

Selling Point (Customer Perspective):
AI-assisted framework that turns analysts and business users into ontology builders — enabling rapid, scalable, and affordable ontology creation for MBSE, Digital Twin, and Digital Thread programs across NASA, DoD, and RTX ecosystems.

🔹 Problem Definition & Impact (Left Quadrant)

Problem Definition

Ontology & knowledge-graph creation: slow, expert-dependent, high cost.

Limited ontology expertise across programs; bottlenecks digital-thread adoption.

Manual tools (Protégé, Stardog, etc.) require advanced logic skills.

Growing need to formalize NASA, DoD, MIL standards for interoperability.

Ontology projects (e.g., DPHM) show value but cannot scale.

Relation to Seedling Solicitation

Addresses disruptive digital-engineering automation and trusted AI for knowledge modeling.

Impact

Democratizes ontology creation via AI guidance.

40 % faster development cycles; lower cost of entry.

Improves data integration, MBSE, and decision-support readiness.

CRAD Targets: NASA (standards integration), DoD (MBSE), DARPA (semantic autonomy).

Transition: Integrate into RTX DTX & Nexus pipelines for enterprise reuse.

🔹 New Idea (Right Quadrant)

Idea

LLM-assisted framework for generating domain ontologies & knowledge graphs.

Human-in-the-loop validation; converts natural-language standards into formal logic.

Auto-maps entities, properties, relationships; exports to RDF/Turtle.

Novelty

First human–machine teaming approach for scalable ontology engineering.

Converts public standards (NASA/DoD/MIL) into actionable knowledge.

Learns continuously from SME feedback.

Value Beyond Current Practice

Replaces months of manual modeling with guided AI collaboration.

Enables non-experts to contribute; improves traceability & quality.

Risks / Mitigation

LLM bias or logic errors → human review loop + ontology validator.

Sensitive data → Azure OpenAI secured, audited environment.

Why It Succeeds

Builds on RTX ontology heritage (DPHM, Manufacturing, REO).

Direct fit with enterprise digital-thread & affordability goals.

🔹 Path Forward / Seeding Plan (Bottom Quadrant)
