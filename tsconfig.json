Subject: Online Courses for AI & Digital Transformation Learning

Hi [Manager’s Name],

As we discussed, I’ve shortlisted two online courses that align closely with my current role and our ongoing AI and digital transformation initiatives:

MIT Professional Education – “Applied Agentic AI for Organizational Transformation”
• Duration: 8 weeks (starting December 2, 2025)
• Effort: ~6–8 hours per week
• Cost: US $2,880 (after 10% early enrollment discount before Nov 6, 2025)
• Focus: Generative & Agentic AI, AI strategy, ethics/governance, and practical frameworks for enterprise transformation.

Google Advanced Data Analytics Professional Certificate (Coursera)
• Duration: ~6 months (flexible schedule, ~10 hours per week)
• Cost: Included in Coursera Plus (~US $399/year)
• Focus: Data analysis, regression models, Python, ML, and visualization—hands-on analytics aligned with AI applications.

Both are highly relevant to building AI-enabled decision-support and transformation capabilities in our work.
Please let me know if I can proceed with enrollment for the MIT program, and later plan for the Coursera certificate as a supplementary course.

Best regards,
Shatad
