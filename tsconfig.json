This project focuses on developing and validating robust digital twin models for a complex aeroelastic system. These models are designed to accurately estimate the system's complete dynamic state and forecast its future behavior in real-time. A key objective is to ensure this can be done reliably, even when using incomplete or corrupted sensor data from the physical asset.
