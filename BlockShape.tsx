Dear Jim,
I am reaching out to reconnect. Thank you again for your earlier outreach regarding OAGi IOF membership.
I want to share that RTX Corporation is now ready to move forward as a Governing Member of OAGi IOF. We would like to begin the process as soon as possible.
On our side, we will need an invoice for membership dues and will also need OAGi to be set up in the RTX vendor portal to process payments. Please let us know what information you require from us to initiate those steps.
At RTX, we are advancing ontology-driven solutions across multiple domains. By joining OAGi IOF as a Governing Member, our goal is to both contribute to ontology standards and align our enterprise work with the community’s practices. 
We are particularly interested in:
•	Ontology modeling patterns and tools being developed within IOF.
•	Opportunities to bring real-world use cases into the working groups, where collaboration with IOF participants could accelerate progress on both sides.
We view this membership as a key platform to collaborate, share use cases, and engage actively in governance, technical oversight, and working groups.
Please let me know the next steps for onboarding, invoicing, and vendor setup.
Best regards,
Shatad Purohit
