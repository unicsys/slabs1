Four Result Cards:

OCKMS Circuit Card Assembly (Collins Aerospace) ✈️

Metric: 30-minute validation meeting
Impact: Complex data integration validated with SMEs in single focused session—previously would take weeks of back-and-forth


GTF Aftermarket Knowledge Graph (RTX Data Governance) 🚀

Metric: 2,000 fields cataloged in weeks
Impact: Out of 800K data fields, 3K were cataloged manually. New AI-assisted approach cataloged 2K more in weeks—hours of time saved with better quality definitions
(Note: I explained "catalog" in executive terms - "cataloged" = "defined and documented")


Raptor Clone Digital Twin (Pratt & Whitney EDX) 🔧

Metric: 8 analysts + business users aligned
Impact: Team struggled to understand data and integration approach—now have clear roadmap using REO Canvas methodology
(Framed as "before confusion → now clarity" which executives understand)


Enterprise Momentum (Across RTX) 📈 - Highlighted in green

Shows three key stats:

18 Reusable Ontologies
15 Modeling Patterns
270+ Active Users


Impact: Growing library of reusable assets accelerating every new project
