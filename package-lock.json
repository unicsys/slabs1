The new representative seems knowledgeable and was able to answer my questions about the pending order. I will schedule a call next week to establish the relationship and review our current requirements.
Inventory,STOCK LOCATION UNKNOWN,CAP-9933,END CAP,04/02/2024 11:45:19 PST JOSEPH SANTOS(0027ZZZ) Eng. Part No.: CAP-9933. Production requested these parts but the warehouse could not locate them even though the system shows we have them in stock. The warehouse supervisor searched the usual locations with no luck. After checking the recent transaction history we found that the parts were moved during the warehouse reorganization last month. The location was not updated in the system. We found the parts in the new location and updated the system. Production now has the parts they need. Warehouse is reviewing procedures to prevent location updates from being missed in the future.
Meeting Required,ENGINEERING REVIEW NEEDED,HNL-2244,HANDLE ASSEMBLY,"04/16/2024 13:20:45 PST KAREN FOSTER(0028AAA) Eng. Part No.: HNL-2244. Production has a question about the assembly sequence and needs engineering to clarify. I scheduled a meeting for tomorrow afternoon with the production supervisor and the responsible engineer. The question is about the order of operations and which step should be done first. This is not a defect or problem with the parts, just a procedural question. Once engineering provides clarification we will update the work instruction if needed. Production has paused work on this assembly until we get the answer to avoid doing it incorrectly."

Machining Defect,TOOL MARKS VISIBLE,HSG-7788,"HOUSING, GEARBOX",01/12/2023 15:45:29 PST RACHEL NGUYEN(0011III) Eng. Part No.: HSG-7788. Machining operation 40 (bore finish) left visible tool marks on the internal bore surface. Drawing specifies 63 microinch surface finish maximum (Ra = 1.6 micrometers) but visual inspection suggests rougher finish. The bore diameter is within tolerance at 2.505 inches (spec: 2.500 +0.006/-0.000 inches). However the finish quality is questionable. Machinist stated the carbide boring bar may need replacement as it has been in use for approximately 500 parts. Surface profilometer measurement needed to confirm actual Ra value. Part is on hold pending measurement results.
Training Issue,OPERATOR NOT CERTIFIED,PCB-1100,CIRCUIT BOARD ASSY,"02/20/2023 10:12:37 PST MICHAEL JOHNSON(0012JJJ) Eng. Part No.: PCB-1100 Work Order: WO-6677. During a routine audit, quality noticed that operator badge #2234 was working on soldering operations without current IPC-A-610 certification. The certification expired last month and the operator did not complete recertification training. This is a requirement per our quality manual section 5.3 and customer specification CS-445. The supervisor was not aware the cert had lapsed. All boards processed by this operator in the past 30 days need to be pulled for re-inspection. Approximately 85 boards are affected. Operator has been scheduled for recertification class next week."

Electrical continuity test per procedure ETP-223 failed on pin 14 of connector J2. Test specification requires resistance less than 0.5 ohms end-to-end for all signal conductors. Measured value was open circuit (>20 megohms) indicating broken conductor. Cable construction: 22 AWG stranded copper per MIL-W-16878 Type E, 26 positions, D-sub connectors per MIL-DTL-24308. Visual inspection of connector crimp showed possible cold crimp on affected pin. X-ray inspection recommended to confirm. Cable will be scrapped if crimp defect confirmed, or reworked if wire break is accessible."
Sheet Metal,EDGE BURR EXCESSIVE,PLT-2233,"PLATE, MOUNTING BASE","06/14/2023 14:10:55 PST CHRISTOPHER ANDERSON(0016NNN) Eng. Part No.: PLT-2233 Drawing: SM-667 Rev E. Laser cut edges exhibit burrs exceeding 0.005 inch height. Drawing note 12 specifies all edges must be deburred, burr height not to exceed 0.003 inch. Material is 5052-H32 aluminum sheet, 0.125 inch thick per QQ-A-250/8. Laser cutting parameters may need adjustment - current settings are 2000W power, 150 IPM feed rate, nitrogen assist gas at 25 PSI. Quality engineer recommends reducing feed rate to 120 IPM or increasing assist gas pressure to 30 PSI. Manual deburring possible but would add significant labor cost. Ten pieces affected, all from same sheet and cutting session."
