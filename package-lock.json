DSQ 3: Cross-Unit Defect Pattern Detection
Question: "Which defect types occur at the same RefDes locations across multiple CCA serial numbers - indicating manufacturing or design flaws?"
Stakeholder: Reliability Engineer, Root Cause Analysis Team, Manufacturing Quality
Objective: Identify systematic issues where the same failure mode appears at the same physical location across different units - suggests design weakness or manufacturing process defect

DSQ 2: Time-Window Defect Trend Analysis
Question: "Between dates X and Y, show defect trends by classification - are failure rates increasing and which CCA designs are most affected?"
Stakeholder: Maintenance Operations Manager, Fleet Reliability Director
Objective: Detect escalating defect rates that indicate aging fleet issues, process degradation, or need for maintenance interval adjustments

DSQ 1: Component Design Failure Impact Analysis
Question: "For failed component design X, which higher assemblies are affected and with what defect types?"
Stakeholder: Engineering Manager, Quality Assurance Director
Objective: Trigger design investigations and potential fleet-wide inspections when a component shows systemic failures across multiple units




Which work center teams are responsible for which defect types on which component designs - are certain teams causing recurring quality issues?,"Manufacturing Quality Manager, Operations Director","Identify teams with systematic quality problems to trigger process audits, retraining, or workflow adjustments before defects escalate",,,
"For a given component design, which teams caused defects at specific reference designators across multiple CCA instances - indicating process or tooling problems?","Root Cause Analysis Team, Manufacturing Engineering","Detect if the same team repeatedly causes failures at the same physical locations, revealing bad tooling, inadequate procedures, or training gaps",,,
"Which CCA designs are most affected by team-caused defects, and do certain defect patterns correlate with specific responsible teams across different products?","VP of Operations, Continuous Improvement Lead","Prioritize team-level interventions by linking defect impact to responsible parties, enabling targeted quality improvement and resource allocation",,,
