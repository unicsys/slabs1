DSQ 1: Conformance Analysis
Question:
"Which manufactured part characteristics are out of tolerance compared to the design specifications, and what is the severity of these deviations?"
Stakeholder:

Quality Engineer / Quality Control Inspector
First Article Inspection (FAI) Lead

Objective:
To rapidly identify non-conforming features by comparing measured inspection values against design tolerances (upper/lower limits) from the QIF files, enabling immediate quality decisions on accept/reject/rework.
Business Value for Company:

Reduce inspection time by 40-60% through automated tolerance comparison vs manual review
Minimize scrap and rework costs through early detection of out-of-spec features
Accelerate FAI approval process for new parts or suppliers
Ensure compliance with AS9100 and aerospace quality standards
Improve on-time delivery by faster quality gate clearance


DSQ 2: Root Cause & Pattern Analysis
Question:
"Are there recurring patterns of dimensional deviations across multiple parts from the same manufacturing process or supplier, and which design features are most frequently non-conformant?"
Stakeholder:

Manufacturing Engineer
Process Engineer
Supplier Quality Engineer (SQE)

Objective:
To identify systematic manufacturing issues by aggregating inspection data across multiple parts, correlating deviations with specific features, processes, or suppliers to drive corrective actions.
Business Value for Company:

Prevent defect propagation by catching systematic process issues early
Optimize manufacturing processes through data-driven improvements
Reduce Cost of Poor Quality (COPQ) by addressing root causes vs symptoms
Improve supplier performance management with objective data
Enable predictive maintenance of tooling/machines showing drift patterns
Support Six Sigma/continuous improvement initiatives with traceability


DSQ 3: Traceability & Compliance Documentation
Question:
"For a given serial-numbered part, what is the complete inspection history showing conformance to design requirements, and can this be traced to the specific manufacturing batch, machine, and operator?"
Stakeholder:

Quality Assurance Manager
Regulatory Compliance Officer
Program Manager (for customer audits)
Supply Chain Quality Manager

Objective:
To provide end-to-end traceability linking design requirements → manufacturing execution → inspection results for regulatory compliance, customer audits, and incident investigations.
Business Value for Company:

Meet AS9100/NADCAP certification requirements for traceability
Accelerate customer audits and certifications (FAA, EASA, customer reviews)
Enable rapid incident response - if a part fails in field, quickly identify all similar parts
Reduce liability exposure through comprehensive quality documentation
Support aftermarket/warranty claims with objective inspection data
Streamline supplier certification with standardized QIF-based documentation
